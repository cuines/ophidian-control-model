# Ophidian Control Model

This proof-of-concept project models the potential impact of using native Carpet Pythons (*Morelia spilota*) to control invasive European rabbit populations in a simulated Australian ecosystem. The goal is to create a simple, reproducible predator-prey dynamic model and document the entire process using professional GitHub workflows.
